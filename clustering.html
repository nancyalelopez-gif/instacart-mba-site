      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
The process starts with preparing a user–department matrix based on each customer’s reorder behavior. This matrix captures how often users repurchase items across different departments, providing a behavioral profile for each customer.
Next, K-Means clustering is applied to group users with similar purchasing patterns. Dimensionality reduction with PCA helps visualize these clusters and their centroids, making the segment structure easier to interpret.
Finally, each segment is analyzed to identify shared characteristics and uncover meaningful shopper types—such as Fresh & Dairy Lovers, Pantry Stock-Uppers, or Snack & Beverage Fans. These insights help inform targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, and strategic decision-making.

      <h2>Elbow Method</h2>
      <p>
K-means: The customer segmentation process began
with a data preparation stage, which involved calculating the
reorder rate for each user and constructing a user–department
matrix in which the rows represent users, the columns represent departments, and the values correspond to each user’s
reorder rate. This matrix was then used as input for the
clustering stage, where the K-Means algorithm was applied to
group users into distinct clusters. Based on the elbow method a value of K = 5 was selected.

      <h2>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</h2>
      <p>
        Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used
to reduce dimensionality. The result is visualized as
segments and their centroids, as seen in the scatter plot. The segment analysis stage takes these
clusters to summarize each segment and provide insights,
yielding distinct customer profiles such as ”Core Grocery
Essentials,” ”Bulk/Stock-up shoppers,” and ”Family-oriented”.
This methodology leverages reorder behavior and machine
learning to move from raw user data to actionable, distinct
customer segments.

      <h2>Customer Segmentation Based on Reorder Rate</h2>
      <p>
        The customer segmentation process, driven by reorder patterns, identified five
distinct customer segments, each presenting unique traits and
opportunities for targeted marketing.
        <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Segment 1:</strong> the Core Grocery Essentials, one of the
          largest group with about 56K customers; ideal to target
          them with strategies like category cross-selling so they
          can expand the items purchase footprint.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Segment 2:</strong> characterized as Infrequent Buyers with
          low reorder behavior, is the largest group with 67K
          users, offering the primary opportunity for retention and
          activation campaigns.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Segment 3: </strong> the Bulk/Stock-up Shoppers; this group
          exhibits a high reorder behavior despite being the smallest
          segment at 1.8K users, making them ideal for loyalty and
          subscription offers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Segment 4:</strong> the Family-oriented customers with about
          6.7K users; they exibit high reorder behavior on deparments like Babies, Dairy Eggs, and Produce; this segment
          is ideal to be targeted with family bundles specials.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Segment 5:</strong> the Premium loyalists with about 26K users
          in this group, demonstrates High and broad reorder behavior and is suited for VIP rewards and early access.
        </li>
          </ul>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
K-means: The customer segmentation process began
with a data preparation stage, which involved calculating the
reorder rate for each user and constructing a user–department
matrix in which the rows represent users, the columns represent departments, and the values correspond to each user’s
reorder rate. This matrix was then used as input for the
clustering stage, where the K-Means algorithm was applied to
group users into distinct clusters. Based on the elbow method a value of K = 5 was selected.

      <h2>Elbow Method</h2>
      <p>
 Online grocery orders
peak on Saturdays and Sundays, especially between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.,
suggesting that many customers use the weekend to prepare
for the week. Thursdays display the lowest order volume.

      <h2>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</h2>
      <p>
        Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used
to reduce dimensionality. The result is visualized as
segments and their centroids, as seen in the scatter plot. The segment analysis stage takes these
clusters to summarize each segment and provide insights,
yielding distinct customer profiles such as ”Core Grocery
Essentials,” ”Bulk/Stock-up shoppers,” and ”Family-oriented”.
This methodology leverages reorder behavior and machine
learning to move from raw user data to actionable, distinct
customer segments.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
The customer segmentation process begins with preparing a user–department matrix based on each shopper’s reorder behavior. This matrix captures how often users repurchase items across different departments, providing a behavioral profile for each customer.
Next, K-Means clustering is applied to group users with similar purchasing patterns. Dimensionality reduction with PCA helps visualize these clusters and their centroids, making the segment structure easier to interpret.
Finally, each segment is analyzed to identify shared characteristics and uncover meaningful shopper types—such as Fresh & Dairy Lovers, Pantry Stock-Uppers, or Snack & Beverage Fans. These insights help inform targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, and strategic decision-making.

      <h2>Elbow Method</h2>
      <p>
K-means: The customer segmentation process began
with a data preparation stage, which involved calculating the
reorder rate for each user and constructing a user–department
matrix in which the rows represent users, the columns represent departments, and the values correspond to each user’s
reorder rate. This matrix was then used as input for the
clustering stage, where the K-Means algorithm was applied to
group users into distinct clusters. Based on the elbow method a value of K = 5 was selected.

      <h2>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</h2>
      <p>
        Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used
to reduce dimensionality. The result is visualized as
segments and their centroids, as seen in the scatter plot. The segment analysis stage takes these
clusters to summarize each segment and provide insights,
yielding distinct customer profiles such as ”Core Grocery
Essentials,” ”Bulk/Stock-up shoppers,” and ”Family-oriented”.
This methodology leverages reorder behavior and machine
learning to move from raw user data to actionable, distinct
customer segments.

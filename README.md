Abstract
The rapid growth of e-commerce and digital grocery
platforms has generated an unprecedented volume of transactional
data, creating new opportunities to understand customer
purchasing behavior at scale. Such insights are essential for
optimizing operations, enhancing recommendation systems, and
improving the overall shopping experience in an increasingly
competitive retail environment. In this study, the Instacart’s
online grocery dataset is analyzed using a combination of data
mining techniques, including exploratory analysis, association
rule mining, and clustering. These complementary approaches
allow capturing behavioral patterns, uncovering relationships
among co-purchased items, and identifying distinct customer
segments. Preprocessing steps were applied to ensure data quality
and support the analytical workflow. The findings highlight how
different analytical perspectives contribute to a deeper understanding
of customer behavior, offering practical implications for
recommendation systems, store layout optimization, and crossselling
strategies.

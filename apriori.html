    <h2>Association Rule Mining (Apriori Algorithm)</h2>
    <p>
    Association Rule Mining (Apriori Algorithm) is used to identify predictable and hidden relationships between items
    purchased together within a single Instacart transaction. The analysis is driven by three core metrics that are used to
    evaluate the strength and importance of each rule. 
    • Support: Measures how frequently an item combination appears in 
    the entire dataset. 
    • Confidence: Indicates the reliability of the rule (e.g. the probability of buying item Y given that item X has
      already been purchased).
    • Lift: Quantifies the strength of the association. A Lift value greater than 1.0 means the two items are more likely
      to be bought together than if they were independent, confirming a positive relationship.

      <h2>Time-Based Ordering Patterns</h2>
      <p>
      Online grocery orders peak on Saturdays and Sundays, especially between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.,
      suggesting that many customers use the weekend to prepare for the week. Thursdays display the lowest order volume.

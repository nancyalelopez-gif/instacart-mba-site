      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project analyzes millions of Instacart orders to understand how customers shop for groceries
        online. Using the publicly available Instacart dataset, the analysis focuses on ordering patterns,
        products frequently purchased together, reorder behavior, and customer segmentation.

      <h2>Time-Based Ordering Patterns</h2>
      <p>
 Online grocery orders
peak on Saturdays and Sundays, especially between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.,
suggesting that many customers use the weekend to prepare
for the week. Thursdays display the lowest order volume.

      <h2>Weekend vs Weekday Trends</h2>
      <p>
The horizontal bar graph shows that produce,
canned goods, and frozen items are more common on weekends. Beverages, snacks, and breakfast items are more popular
on weekdays. Items in the middle, such as bakery and bulk,
are consistent through the week.
